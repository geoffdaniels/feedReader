## Installation

Download/clone to computer, open index.html and check bottom for pass/fail. Open favorite text editor to view code.

## How It Works

Through a series of .js files, the page communicates with the code to test for pass/fail of the page. Open the index.html file and the Jasmine results panel is in the site's footer showing pass/fail of the specs coded in the feedreader.js file.

## Features

* Simple page that displays the title links for the pages linked to the app.js file
* Includes the feedreader.js file as our spec file for running test suites
* Each suite targets specific groups of the site ensuring expectations are met

## Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Acknowledgments
